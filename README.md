# Details of Github auto deploy setup
Using GitHub actions, I created a deploy.yml file which runs the deploy script. This deploy script logs onto the deploy account that was created specifically to update the website contents. Everytime a commit is pushed to the repository, the script is triggered, in which it uploads the contents of the repository into the var/www/ directory.
